                <div class="project-about">
                    For this project, I wanted to build a device that could detect heart beats and tell me the beats
                    per minute (bpm). I felt that by incorporating a biological metric like heart rate into my project,
                    it would make for an interesting blend of circuitry, coding, and data analysis, as well as the 
                    added benefit of being able to let other people try out the device. The goals of the project were as
                    follows:
                    <ul class="subsection-list">
                        <li>Build a circuit that can detect heart beats</li>
                        <li>Display heart beats on my computer</li>
                        <li>Display average bpm over time</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    Creation Process
                </div>
                <div class="project-creation">
                    Here, I've divided the project creation process into 4 categories: Research, Gathering Materials,
                    Building the Device, and Interpreting the Data.

                        <p>I knew for this project I wanted to have some way of measuring heart beats. I looked into 
                            some 
                            options and ended up deciding on the <b>MAX30102 Oximeter and Heart Rate Sensor Module.</b> 
                            This module 
                            generates infrared (IR) and red light that penetrates the skin and underlying tissues. It detects
                            the amount of light absorbed or reflected by blood. When the heart beats, the blood volume
                            in the finger
                            (or any other part of the body) changes, causing corresponding changes in light absoportion. 
                            We can use this fact to accurately detect pulse rate and/or blood oxygen levels.</p>

                        <p>
                            In order to use the MAX30102, I would need a microcontroller along with a breadboard and 
                            some jumper wires. Once the device was set up, I figured I could connect it to my 
                            computer and interpret the data from there. Luckily, the MAX30102 has an Arduino library
                            built specifically for this purpose, meaning I would not need to do all of the hard 
                            data analysis on my own.

                            I began by buying the MAX30102 module on Amazon. Unfortunately, after waiting a week it had 
                            still not arrived, so I bought another one from a different supplier, which came within two
                            days of purchase. As for the microcontroller, jumper wires, and breadboard, I heard that 
                            BLIECE (Black Latino and Indigienous in ECE) was hosting 
                            an Arduino workshop where they would be giving out these exact materials, and they
                            would also teach us some basics on how to use them. I attended this and was ready to begin 
                            building.

                        <p>
                            With all of the materials gathered, I headed over to the Aero Maker Space (AMS) at Georgia 
                            Tech so I could use a soldering iron to solder my MAX30102 onto its associated header 
                            pins.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After soldering, I connected the arduino to the correct MAX30102 pins, as shown below.

                            With the connections made, I was ready to move on to writing the code and interpreting the 
                            device's outputs.
