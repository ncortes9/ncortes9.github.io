                    <p>My name is Nicholes Cortes. I am from Statesboro, Georgia, and I am currently a first year
                        Computer Engineering student at Georgia Tech. I am interested in software development and I am
                        actively looking for internship opportunities in this field. I have experience in Python, Java,
                        C++, and HTML/CSS (which is how I made this website), most of which I have acquired through
                        my various classes and clubs at Georgia Tech. To see more about these experiences and skills,
                        see the experience section below as well as the Portfolio tab on the navigation bar. Outside of 
                        my professional life, I enjoy running, weightlifting, and playing Fortnite.

                <div class="career-goals">
                    <p>As an undergrad, I hope to intern as a software developer so I can gain valuable real-world 
                        experience early on in my career. As a Computer Engineering Major at Georgia Tech, I have
                        privilege of selecting two "threads", which are essentially concentrations for my degree.
                        My decision is not finalized, but I am currently planning on doing (1) Distributed System and
                        Software Design and (2) Information Internetworks.
                        I am on track to finish my Computer Engineering degree in the Spring of 2027.
                        Once I complete my Bachelor's, I want to pursue a Master's in Computer Science, which I would
                        start in the Fall of 2027. In order to do this, I need to apply for graduate school in the Fall
                        of 2026. I will likely apply to several schools, but for Georgia Tech specifically this will
                        require letters of recommendation and GRE scores. With my experience in internships and graduate
                        school, I then hope to begin work as a software engineer, which will likely be in 2029.

                        <p>Knack is a platform offered at colleges and universities that allows students to request
                            one-on-one tutoring from qualified peers. To become a peer tutor for a course, you must
                            pass the class with an A and complete the Knack training course. I am currently a Peer
                            Tutor for several Physics, Math, and CS courses. For a complete list, see the "Coursework"
                            section below. I typically hold several sessions each week, some online and some in person.
                            Tutoring for Knack has allowed me to develop my technical communication skills and
                            strengthened my skills in many foundational courses. I
                            love tutoring for Knack because it allows me to reap these benefits without having a 
                            large time commitment and with extremely flexible hours. It's something I can see myself 
                            continuing to participate in as I attend Georgia Tech. Below, I have listed some student

                        <p>Competitive Programming at Georgia Tech is a club dedicated to solving complex coding
                            problems that often require great intuition and advanced knowledge of data structures and
                            algorithms. We meet weekly to discuss different problem solving techniques as well as to
                            practive solving problems as a team. Every Fall, the club participates in the Regional 
                            International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). My team, which consisted of two 
                            first-years students and a second-year student, placed 44th in this competition out of
                            over 100 teams. I'm extremely excited to see how I continue to improve my competitive 
                            programming skills as I get more practice and learn more problem-solving techniques
                            through our meetings and my coursework.
